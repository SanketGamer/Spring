DI(dependency injection) - another class object that a class needs to work, Giving required class objects from outside rather than creating them inside.

Ex- 

-- i have Geeta class - 
class Geeta(){

   public void doWork(){
     ..........
   }

}


another file i have class ramu - 
--in there what i want... Geetas property so i have to inject in Ramu class Geetas object this is called dependency injection...
class Ramu{

    Geeta obj;  --dependency inject

    -- dependency injection
    Ramu(Geeta obj){
      this.obj=obj;
     }

    public void doWork(){
      .........
    }

}
